class HttpResponseÂ¶
In contrast to HttpRequest objects, which are created automatically by Django, 
HttpResponse objects are your responsibility. 
Each view you write is responsible for instantiating, populating, and returning an HttpResponse.

The HttpResponse class lives in the django.http module.
